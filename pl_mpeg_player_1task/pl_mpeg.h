-- Documentation

This library provides several interfaces to load, demux and decode MPEG video
and audio data. A high-level API combines the demuxer, video & audio decoders
in an easy to use wrapper.

Lower-level APIs for accessing the demuxer, video decoder and audio decoder,
as well as providing different data sources are also available.

Interfaces are written in an object oriented style, meaning you create object
instances via various different constructor functions (plm_*create()),
do some work on them and later dispose them via plm_*destroy().

plm_* ......... the high-level interface, combining demuxer and decoders
plm_buffer_* .. the data source used by all interfaces
plm_demux_* ... the MPEG-PS demuxer
plm_video_* ... the MPEG1 Video ("mpeg1") decoder
plm_audio_* ... the MPEG1 Audio Layer II ("mp2") decoder


With the high-level interface you have two options to decode video & audio:

 1. Use plm_decode() and just hand over the delta time since the last call.
		It will decode everything needed and call your callbacks (specified through
		plm_set_{video|audio}_decode_callback()) any number of times.

 2. Use plm_decode_video() and plm_decode_audio() to decode exactly one
		frame of video or audio data at a time. How you handle the synchronization
		of both streams is up to you.

If you only want to decode video *or* audio through these functions, you should
disable the other stream (plm_set_{video|audio}_enabled(FALSE))

Video data is decoded into a struct with all 3 planes (Y, Cr, Cb) stored in
separate buffers. You can either convert this to RGB on the CPU (slow) via the
plm_frame_to_rgb() function or do it on the GPU with the following matrix:

mat4 bt601 = mat4(
	1.16438,  0.00000,  1.59603, -0.87079,
	1.16438, -0.39176, -0.81297,  0.52959,
	1.16438,  2.01723,  0.00000, -1.08139,
	0, 0, 0, 1
);
gl_FragColor = vec4(y, cb, cr, 1.0) * bt601;

Audio data is decoded into a struct with either one single float array with the
samples for the left and right channel interleaved, or if the
PLM_AUDIO_SEPARATE_CHANNELS is defined *before* including this library, into
two separate float arrays - one for each channel.


Data can be supplied to the high level interface, the demuxer and the decoders
in three different ways:

 1. Using plm_create_from_filename() or with a file handle with
		plm_create_from_file().

 2. Using plm_create_with_memory() and supplying a pointer to memory that
		contains the whole file.

 3. Using plm_create_with_buffer(), supplying your own plm_buffer_t instance and
		periodically writing to this buffer.

When using your own plm_buffer_t instance, you can fill this buffer using
plm_buffer_write(). You can either monitor plm_buffer_get_remaining() and push
data when appropriate, or install a callback on the buffer with
plm_buffer_set_load_callback() that gets called whenever the buffer needs more
data.

A buffer created with plm_buffer_create_with_capacity() is treated as a ring
buffer, meaning that data that has already been read, will be discarded. In
contrast, a buffer created with plm_buffer_create_for_appending() will keep all
data written to it in memory. This enables seeking in the already loaded data.


There should be no need to use the lower level plm_demux_*, plm_video_* and
plm_audio_* functions, if all you want to do is read/decode an MPEG-PS file.
However, if you get raw mpeg1video data or raw mp2 audio data from a different
source, these functions can be used to decode the raw data directly. Similarly,
if you only want to analyze an MPEG-PS file or extract raw video or audio
packets from it, you can use the plm_demux_* functions.


This library uses malloc(), realloc() and free() to manage memory. Typically
all allocation happens up-front when creating the interface. However, the
default buffer size may be too small for certain inputs. In these cases plmpeg
will realloc() the buffer with a larger size whenever needed. You can configure
the default buffer size by defining PLM_BUFFER_DEFAULT_SIZE *before*
including this library.

You can also define PLM_MALLOC, PLM_REALLOC and PLM_FREE to provide your own
memory management functions.
